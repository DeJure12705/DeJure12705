## Hi there 👋

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

🔭 I’m currently working on... trying to remember why I opened this repo in the first place😜.

🌱 I’m currently learning... that "just one more bug fix" actually means three hours of debugging😭.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on... anything that doesn’t involve CSS (because let's be honest, it's witchcraft)🧙‍♀️.

🤔 I’m looking for help with... figuring out how my code works after a week of not looking at it😎.

💬 Ask me about... absolutely anything just don’t expect a correct answer😇.

📫 How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon or, you know, just DM me🕊️.

😄 Pronouns: Code/Nap/Debug😴

⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote "TODO" in my code and actually came back to do it. (It’s a rare achievement.)😱
