## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**DeJure12705/DeJure12705** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on... trying to remember why I opened this repo in the first place.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... that "just one more bug fix" actually means three hours of debugging
.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on... anything that doesnâ€™t involve CSS (because let's be honest, it's witchcraft).

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... figuring out how my code works after a week of not looking at it.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about... absolutely anythingâ€”just donâ€™t expect a correct answer.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon or, you know, just DM me.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Code/Nap/Debug

âš¡ Fun fact: I once wrote "TODO" in my code and actually came back to do it. (Itâ€™s a rare achievement.)
